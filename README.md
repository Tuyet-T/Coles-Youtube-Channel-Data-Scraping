I practice data scraping using Selenium in Python to extract information from Coles Youtube videos.
Apologize for such a long warning in the code file but please continue scroll down and ignore that.
After pulling out the data about video title, video link, published date, like count, view count, comment count and specific commenter's name and content for each, I performed some cleaning and data exploration such as overview statistics and graphs.
